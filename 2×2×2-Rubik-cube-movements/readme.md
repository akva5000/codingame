# Goal

You have to print the colours of the `Front` side of a 2×2×2 Rubik’s cube after some moves.  
The colours are named by the first letter of each side (`Front`, `Back`, `Right`, `Left`, `Up`, `Down`).  
The moves are named the same way if you turn the side `clockwise`.  
For example `F` moves the `Front` side clockwise, `F` turns it anticlockwise and `F2` turns it twice.  
`B` turns it clockwise when you look at the `Back` side.  
You won’t be given moves such as `F5`, `B52` or `U'3`.
