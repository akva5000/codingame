# Goal

There is a mysterious data structure.  
This structure is like a bag which allows putting data in and taking data out.  
You have to guess what structure it is by looking at its behaviors.

To keep it simple, we limit our analysis to only three known data structures:  
**Queue** (First In First Out)  
**Stack** (First In Last Out)  
**Priority** Queue (Bigger data come out first)

We use only two operators to try out the structure:
i - input data, similar to [add, put, push, insert, ...]  
o - output data, similar to [pop, poll, pull, delete, ...]

The data are simple integers.

At the beginning, the data structure is empty.  
There will be a sequence of operations done on the structure.  
Analyze the result then tell what data structure it is.
