# Goal

## The program:
You must detect speeding vehicles by computing their average speed between two or more consecutive cameras on a given road.  
You must print the License plate and the position of the camera where the excess speed has been detected.

Your inputs contain all camera timestamped recordings for one or more license plates.  
All records are grouped by license plates and all camera distances are sorted in ascending order inside this group.  
If no excess speed is detected, your program must print OK.
