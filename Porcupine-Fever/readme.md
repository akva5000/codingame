# Goal

You have a hobby of visiting a porcupine farm.  
Porcupines are kept in cages and regularly fed.  
They are usually healthy and have been one of the rodents with longest lifespans,  
but **some of these porcupines are sick**.

Every year, each porcupines who were sick last year will **cause** `2` **healthy porcupines**  
in the same cage to be **sick**, and then **die**.

Simulate to find the **total amount** of surviving porcupines after every year.  
Stop if all the porcupines are dead (do not repeat `"0"`s after the first time).
